        <h1>Biography of Louise Joy Brown</h1> 
        <h2 class="header">Louise Joy Brown - an English woman noted as the first human born following conception by <em>in vitro fertilisation IVF</em></h2>
        <h3>In 1977, Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards successfully carried out a pioneering conception which resulted in the birth of the world's first baby to be conceived by <em>IVF</em>, Louise Brown, in Oldham General Hospital, Greater Manchester, UK.</h3> 
        <div>
            <p>Brown's parents, Lesley and John Brown, had been trying to conceive naturally for nine years but Lesley faced complications from blocked fallopian tubes. <br> After numerous attempts to impregnate her mother, Lesley Brown, <em>British medical researcher</em> <strong>Robert Edwards</strong> <br>and <em>British gynecologist</em> <strong>Patrick Steptoe</strong> tried fertilizing oocyte in a Petri dish. This was achieved in a “natural” <em>IVF</em> cycle, with no stimulation; <br>one oocyte was collected and a single eight-cell embryo was transferred. There followed a difficult pregnancy for Mrs Brown, <br>but her baby, Louise Brown, was delivered by cesarian section <strong>on July 25, 1978</strong>. <br>Much to everyone’s relief, baby Louise was found to be a perfectly normal, fit and healthy infant.</p>
            <p><strong>In 1982</strong>, Brown's sister Natalie was born after also being conceived through <em>IVF</em>, becoming <em>the world's 40th such live birth</em>; <strong>in May 1999</strong>, Natalie became the first human conceived by <em>IVF</em> to herself give birth, though she did so without <em>IVF</em>. <br><strong>In 2004</strong>, Brown married nightclub doorman Wesley Mullinder; Edwards, the only surviving member from the trio who pioneered <em>IVF</em>, attended their wedding. Their first son, conceived naturally, was born <strong>on 20 December 2006</strong>. <br>She has since had another child. Brown's father died in 2006 <em>at the age of 64</em>, while her mother died in 2012 due to complications from a gallbladder infection, also <em>at the age of 64</em>.</p>
            <h3>Recognition</h3>
            <p>Brown's birth has been lauded as one of the <em>"most remarkable medical breakthroughs of the 20th century"</em>. Edwards was awarded <strong>the 2010 Nobel Prize</strong> in Medicine for this work.<br><strong>In 2022</strong>, a plaque was installed on Royal Oldham Hospital to record the importance of Purdy and Sister Muriel Harris to the work. The film <a href="https://www.louisejoybrown.co.uk/blog/film-joy-tells-story-of-ivf">"Joy"</a> was released on Netflix worldwide <strong>on 22 November 2024</strong>. Based on real events <em>in the 1960s and 1970s</em>, nurse and embryologist Jean Purdy, visionary scientist Dr Robert Edwards and innovative surgeon Patrick Steptoe work to develop the first <em>'test tube baby'</em>.</p>
